<h2 align="center" ><p><u>Assigned Number</u></p></h2><p>In a school, a class has 'r' rows and every column has 'b' chairs. Every chair has a student sitting on it.</p><p>Every row is assigned a decimal number 'n'. After converting the number to binary and adding leading zeroes to make the length of the number equal to 'b', each student is assigned a number '0' or '1'.According to the following rule, the class is assigned a number -</p><p>- If the number of students in a column, having number '1' is even, the column is assigned number '0', else it is assigned number '1'.</p><p>- Thus, every column has either '1' or '0' assigned to it.</p><p>- The binary number formed by the combination of numbers assigned to each column is converted to decimal form, and this number is called 'D'.</p><p>Given the numbers assigned to each row, your task is to find the number assigned to the class.</p><br></br><h4 align="center"><u> INPUT </u></h4><p>The first line contains 2 space-separated integers - r and b.</p><h4 align="center"><u> OUTPUT </u></h4><p>The next r lines contain an integer each.Output an integer - the number assigned to the class.</p><h4 align="center"><u> CONSTRAINTS </u></h4><br>2<=r<=10^9</br><br>0<=n<=10^18</br><br>1<=b<=100</br><h4 align="center"><u> SAMPLE TESTS </u></h4><p>1:</p><p><p>Input-</p>4 8<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<p>Output-</p><p>4</p></p>
